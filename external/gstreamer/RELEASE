Release notes for GStreamer 0.10.32 "Take Me to the Bonus Level"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.


This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect



  

Features of this release
    
      * GLib requirement is now >= 2.22
      * New core element: valve (moved from -bad)
      * New core element: input-selector (N.B. without "select-all" property, use fsfunnel instead) (moved from -bad)
      * New core element: output-selector (with different negotiation behaviour by default, set pad-negotiation-mode=active for previous behaviour) (moved from -bad)
      * Performance improvements for many heavily-used code paths: GstPad, GstPoll, GstClock, GstTask, basesink, basesrc, queue2, multiqueue (use atomic ops make many code-paths
      * gobject-introspection: add annotations for most core API
      * clock: make sync clock wait lockfree
      * fdsrc/fdsink: reenable on MSVC
      * registry: fix GStatBuf definition for win32 when building against older glib (fixes unnecessary rescanning of plugins at start-up)
      * element: add a more flexible way to get request pads from elements
      * multiqueue: return upon input when already eos
      * object: fix creation of default name (when creating more than 100000 elements)
      * pluginloader: fix hangs on OSX
      * poll: fixes for (p)select backend (used e.g. on OSX)
      * poll: refactor and make more lockfree; fixes for win32 and OSX (pselect backend)
      * registry: don't replace valid existing plugins by blacklisted ones
      * tags: don't produce duplicated entries when merging same value twice
      * basesink: preroll fixes for async=false case
      * basesink: rework position reporting code
      * basetransform: handle downstream giving a buffer with new caps but invalid size
